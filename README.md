# Headless CMS Starter: Sanity + 11ty + Bootstrap

This starter lets you manage a CMS locally and build your site with it.
You can create and update landing pages through a simple web interface, and 11ty rebuilds the site automatically.
It goes beyond plain markdown by supporting Sanityâ€™s content blocks, so you can design rich, flexible pages while keeping full control of your content and code.

It comes with a set of scripts to quickly generate and run a new web project using Sanity.io as a local headless CMS, 11ty as a static site generator, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Sanity CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/cli): `npm install -g @sanity/cli`
- [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/): `npm install -g pm2`

You will also need a Sanity.io account.

## Setup

1.  **Create a Sanity Project:**
    Go to [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage) and create a new project. Once it's created, you will be able to find your `projectId` in the project settings. You will need this for the `.env` file.

2.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sanity-11ty-bootstrap.git
    cd sanity-11ty-bootstrap
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

    ```
    PROJECT_NAME="my-awesome-project"
    SANITY_PROJECT_ID="your-sanity-project-id"
    SANITY_DATASET="production"
    ```

    - `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of the directory that will be created for your new project.
    - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sanity project ID from the previous step.
    - `SANITY_DATASET`: The name of your Sanity dataset (e.g., "production").

4.  **Make Scripts Executable:**

    Before you can run the scripts, you need to make them executable. Run the following command from the generator's root directory:

    ```bash
    chmod +x generate.sh serve.sh stop.sh update.sh
    ```

5.  **Log in to Sanity:**
    If you haven't already, log in to your Sanity account from the command line:
    ```bash
    sanity login
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Generate the Project

Create a directory for your new project, `cd` into it, and run `generate.sh` pointing to your new directory. For example:
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
../sanity-11ty-bootstrap/generate.sh .
```

This will populate your project directory with two subdirectories: `cms` (for Sanity Studio) and `web` (for your 11ty site).

### 2. Run the Development Servers

To start the development servers for both Sanity Studio and your 11ty site, run `serve.sh` from your project's directory:

```bash
../sanity-11ty-bootstrap/serve.sh .
```

This script uses `pm2` to run the servers in the background. It will also automatically open your new site and Sanity Studio in your web browser.

- **11ty Site:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Sanity Studio:** `http://localhost:3333`

### 3. Stop the Development Servers

To stop all running development servers, use the `stop.sh` script from your project's directory:

```bash
../sanity-11ty-bootstrap/stop.sh .
```

This will stop the `pm2` processes for the 11ty site, Sanity Studio, and the content listener.

### 4. Updating Schemas

If you have updated the schemas in the `bootstrap` directory of the generator, you can update an existing project with the new schemas by running the `update.sh` script from your project's directory:

```bash
../sanity-11ty-bootstrap/update.sh .
```
